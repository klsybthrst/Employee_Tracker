<h2>Roadmap<h2>

<p>To further develop this application I could allow the user to update employee's managers, view employees by managers and add a delete function. It would also be nice to automatically hide duplicates in roles so when the user is updating he/she does not have to scroll through extra lines (ie Lawyer, Lawyer, Lawyer).</p>
